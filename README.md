# Trim The Noise

**Trim The Noise** is a simple browser extension that automatically hides promoted posts on LinkedIn, helping you focus on real content in your feed.

## Features

- Automatically detects and hides all promoted posts in your LinkedIn feed.
- Works in multiple languages by detecting common "Promoted" labels.
- Lightweight and privacy-friendly — no tracking or permissions required.

## Installation

### For Developers

1. Clone this repo or download the source code.
2. Load the unpacked extension in your browser’s extension settings (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
3. Enjoy an ad-free LinkedIn feed!

### For Users

Coming soon to the Chrome Web Store and other extension marketplaces!

## How it Works

The extension scans your LinkedIn feed for posts containing the “Promoted” label (and variations), then automatically hides them by applying CSS styles.
